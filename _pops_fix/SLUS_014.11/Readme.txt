- *Yu-Gi-Oh! Forbidden Memories* (All versions) {POPStarter Fix by Hugopocked}
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The patch that Hugopocked has made fixes the flickering at the top of the screen.

Copy all the TROJAN files into the game folder that contains the virtual memory cards (VMC).

Along with the patch a CHEATS.TXT file is provided which includes other optional functions that are disabled 
and that you can activate by editing the file if you wish.
